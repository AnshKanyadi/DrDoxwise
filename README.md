Code needs to be adjusted to work. Create a pictures folder and set the directory to it in the code (folder can be named anything). Then, create a Temp folder, Filtered Images folder, and Altered Images folder (word for word caps sensitive). Also, change discord token and channel ID to your values. (sign up for discord developer, and create a bot)
